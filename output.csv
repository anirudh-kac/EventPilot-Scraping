Abstract:Junliang Yuan Sr., MD, McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School,, Boston, MA, USA; Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical Univerisity, Beijing, ChinaBackground: To explore the clinical characteristics of the cognitive disorders in patients with small vessel disease (SVD). Method: A total of 60 patients with SVD and 50 age, gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited consecutively from the department of Neurology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. All the participants were performed by a battery of neuropsychological tests. The Fazekas scale was utilized to assess the severity of white matter lesions, and the scale of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was to evaluate the severity of medial temporal lobe. Result: Patients with SVD were associated with global cognitive function deficits, including the general tests of MMSE (25.9±2.4 vs 28.1±1.7) and MoCA (23.0±3.7 vs 26.2±3.0), and also with performances of AVLD-I, AVLT-D, AVLT-R, TMT-B, Stroop B, Stroop C and DST（P＜0.05）. The score of MOCA was related negatively with Fazekas scale (r=-0.361，P=0.04). The severity of Fazekas had a positive relationship with the scores of MTA (r=0.449，P=0.032). Conclusion: Patients with SVD are closely correlated to general cognitive impairment, especially with memory decline, attention and executive function, which may be attributed to the impairment of frontal-subcortical circle.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

According to literature, bv-FTD patients also seem to demonstrate impairments of moral emotions impacting cooperative behaviors, moral judgments, and the ability to respect moral and legal codes. The aim of our study was to explore moral emotions in bv-FTD patients. Method: 22 bv-FTD patients, 15 patients with typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) having positive CSF AD-biomarkers, and 45 healthy controls, were assessed for moral emotions using a new tool called the ‘Moral Emotions Assessment’ task. This tool consisted in 42 scenarios exploring positive and negative moral emotions such as admiration, gratitude, shame or anger. To control for moral-specificity, we contrasted the 42 moral scenarios with 18 extra-moral scenarios eliciting the emotions without involving any inter-human moral context. Result::  Bv-FTD patients were more impaired in emotion processing than AD patients and healthy controls and had significantly poorer performance in the processing of emotions with inter-human moral valence than of emotions without moral contexts. ROC analyses of data on moral scenarios showed a high area under the curve (83%), and indicated a cut-off score (<37/42) for differentiating bv-FTD from AD with a sensitivity of 82 % and specificity of 73 %. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that bv-FTD patients have disorders in emotion processing which is mainly related to failure regarding moral emotions. This specific pattern could help detecting bv-FTD and differentiating it from AD.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)
P2-268,Validity of the Everyday Cognition (ECog) As a Screening Measure of Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD),"Mon, Jul 15  (Pacific)",9:30am - 4:15pm,South Hall GH - Los Angeles Convention Center,https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=Session&project=AAIC19&id=33318,"1,2",MA,"

Recently, it is also beginning to be used as a measure for assessing Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). However, the validity of ECog as a screening measure for SCD has not been examined so far. This study aimed to investigate the validity of the ECog to screen for SCD in community-dwelling older adults by comparing it with an SCD questionnaire that has been validated. Method: The participants were 112 older adults with SCD and 142 without SCD living in the community. The two groups were defined according to their responses of “Yes” or “No” to the question “Do you perceive memory or cognitive difficulties?” The Korean-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), Short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS), Korean version of Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q, Rami et al., 2014), and Korean version of Everyday Cognition (K-ECog) were administered to all the participants. All participants showed normal range of scores on the K-MMSE and SGDS. Result: The total score on K-MMSE was not significantly different between the two groups after controlling for age, educational level, and depression level. The SCD group showed a significantly higher SCD-Q score than the control group. K-ECog was significantly correlated with the SCD-Q (r=0.47, p<.001). The scores on K-ECog global function and five domains except visuospatial function were significantly higher in the SCD than control group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis results showed that the K-ECog global function score effectively differentiated SCD group from control group (AUC: 0.73). The difference between the AUC values of the K-ECog and SCD-Q (0.71) was not significant. Conclusion: These results showed that the ECog is as sensitive and valid for detecting SCD as the SCD-Q in community-dwelling elderly individuals. They suggest that the ECog can be used for screening a whole range of cognitive and functional deficits from SCD, MCI to dementia.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)
P2-269,Geriatric Depression Scale Item-Level Analysis in Relation to In Vivo Cortical Amyloid and Cerebral Regional Tau in Clinically Normal Older Adults: Findings from the Harvard Aging Brain Study,"Mon, Jul 15  (Pacific)",9:30am - 4:15pm,South Hall GH - Los Angeles Convention Center,https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=Session&project=AAIC19&id=34059,"Jennifer R Gatchel, MD, PhD",,"

We previously reported an association between depression measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and regional tauopathy in cognitively unimpaired older adults. The current study was carried out to determine if specific GDS items were related to amyloidosis and regional tauopathy. Method: Cross-sectional data from 135 participants (age:76.30±6.24; 56.3% female), all cognitively unimpaired and with at most mild depression at baseline of the longitudinal Harvard Aging Brain Study, were analyzed. Participants underwent both amyloid (Pittsburgh Compound B) and tau (Flortaucipir) PET scans in study year four, from which continuous values for cortical amyloid and inferior temporal lobe (IT) and entorhinal cortex (EC) tau were derived; depression was assessed using the GDS-30. Adaptive LASSO regression models were employed to perform selection of 17 GDS items (endorsement frequency of >=10% in the sample) and estimate their effects on outcomes amyloid, IT tau and EC tau in a multivariate setting. Age, sex, and education were included in models as unpenalized covariates. Result: Six GDS items were related to amyloidosis: ‘not finding your mind as clear as it used to be’ showed the largest effect (β=0.069), followed by ‘not finding life very exciting’ and ‘feeling you have more problems with memory than most’. In models with tau, fewer items, all focused on cognition, were identified. For EC tau, these included ‘not finding your mind as clear as it used to be’(β=0.086) and ‘feeling you have more problems with memory than most’. Only one item, ‘not finding your mind as clear as it used to be’ was associated with IT tauopathy (β=0.017). Conclusion: In exploratory analyses, specific GDS items were related to cortical amyloidosis and regional tauopathy. Results suggest that in individuals with minimal depressive symptomatology, cognitive concerns may be the most prominent GDS items related to tau. Further longitudinal investigation across a wider range of depression severity is needed to better understand the temporal association of depression-related symptoms in preclinical AD.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)
P2-270,Protective Role of Orexinergic System Overexpression on Cognitive Function in Alzheimer Disease Patients,"Mon, Jul 15  (Pacific)",9:30am - 4:15pm,South Hall GH - Los Angeles Convention Center,https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=Session&project=AAIC19&id=30578,"Soichiro Shimizu, MD., PhD",MD; Kentaro Hirao,"

In particular, a direct association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin A levels and cognitive function has not been reported to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify whether there is a direct association between the orexinergic system and cognitive function in AD. Method: A total of 58 patients with AD who underwent CSF collection by lumbar puncture were enrolled. Correlations between CSF orexin A levels and CSF AD biomarker levels (i.e., levels of phosphorylated tau [P-tau], Aβ40, and Aβ42, and Aβ40/Aβ42and P-tau/Aβ42ratios) were assessed to confirm the results of previous studies. Moreover, the correlation between CSF orexin A levels and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) scores were analyzed. Result: There was a significant correlation between MMSE scores and CSF Aβ42levels (r = 0.293, p = 0.031). CSF orexin-A levels were positively correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.281, p = 0.038), MoCA score (r = 0.378, p = 0.013), and CSF Aβ40 levels (r = 0.374, p = 0.004) in AD patients. Conclusion: This is the first study to our knowledge demonstrating an association between cognitive function and CSF orexin A levels in AD. Our results suggest the possibility that overexpression of the orexinergic system, which occurs in association with the progression of AD pathology, may have protective effects on cognitive function.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Risk factors and modifiers of the clinical and pathological expression of CTE are not well understood. African American (AA) race increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AA race may have similar effects in the setting of CTE. This study compared AA and Caucasian symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players on neurobehavioral outcomes, structural MRI indices, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p=tau), and Aβ. Method: Ninety-five symptomatic former NFL players (ages 40-69; n=42 AA, n=53 Caucasians) underwent neurobehavioral testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture to quantify CSF t-tau, and p-tau181, Aβ1-42using immunoassays. Principal component analysis generated behavior/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, and verbal and visual memory factor scores. FreeSurfer derived volumetric output. The cumulative head impact index (CHII) estimated RHI. Linear regressions examined the effect of AA on each neurobehavioral, structural MRI, and CSF variable, controlling for age, BMI, and the CHII (and intracranial volume for structural MRI, and education for neurobehavioral analyses). Sample sizes varied due to missing data (n=84-86). Result: Compared to Caucasians, AA had a higher BMI (p=0.017) and were three years younger (p=0.025). There were no differences in education or years of play. Compared to Caucasians, AA exhibited worse psychomotor speed/executive function (t=-4.33, p<0.001), had greater white matter hypointensity burden (t=2.96, p=0.004), and smaller volume of the right hippocampus (t=2.97, p=0.004), cortical white matter (t=-2.69, p=0.009), and total gray matter (t=4.51, p<0.001). AA had a higher p-tau181/t-tau ratio (t = 3.09, p = 0.003) and lower Aβ1-42(t=-2.48, p=0.015). Conclusion: In this sample of former NFL players, AA race was associated with worse executive function, greater structural brain alterations, and lower Aβ1-42concentrations and higherp-tau181/t-tau ratio levels. These findings coincide with the extant literature on the differential race effects on neurobehavioral and neurologic outcomes in the general population. AA make up a large proportion of the football population, particularly at the professional level, and studies examining neurologic outcomes in this population should account for race.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Yat Fung Shea, FRCP; Ming Yee Maggie Mok, MBBS; Mi Suen Connie Lee; Hon Wai Felix Chan, FHKAM and Tak-Mao Chan, MD, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong KongBackground: Cognitive impairment (CI) is common among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), but it is under-recognized and systematic information on its prevalence and impact across different geographical locations or patient characteristics is lacking. Method: A search of the literature on CI in PD patients published between 1.Jan.1980 and 31.Oct.2018 was conducted. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of the prevalence of CI. Meta-regression was performed to identify factors contributing to the variance of prevalence rate. A systematic review was also performed to study risk factors of CI and its impact on clinical outcomes. Result: Eight studies were included and the relevant data from 1052 patients was extracted for analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of CI at 21.9% (95% CI 13.2-34.2%). Meta-regression analyses showed that the prevalence of CI was unrelated to patient’s age, gender, duration of PD, healthcare policy of dialysis modality, the prospective or retrospective nature of studies, or year of publication. Systematic review of 17 studies showed that older age, female sex and lower education were risk factors for CI. Also, CI was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, mostly due to PD-related peritonitis. Conclusion: CI is common in patients on long-term PD, and has a significant impact on hospitalization rate. Screening for CI should be considered in PD patients with increased risk.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Jose Angel Soria Lopez, MD, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USABackground: Clinical, neuropsychological, and neurological procedures used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias were largely developed and validated in well-educated, non-Latino, English-speaking populations. Sociocultural and genetic differences in Latinos might influence the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AD and other dementias. We aim to compare the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD and related dementias in Latinos with the corresponding neuropathological diagnosis. Method: From the UCSD Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort, we selected all Latino participants who had autopsy neuropathological studies from 1991 to 2017. Participants underwent annual neurological clinical evaluations, standard neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, and genotyping of Apolipoprotein E. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of AD against the primary pathological diagnosis. Result: Of the 34 participants with a primary neuropathological diagnosis of AD, 33 (97.1%) were correctly clinically diagnosed as having AD at the last clinical evaluation, and 1 was incorrectly diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies. Of the 19 participants without a primary neuropathological diagnosis of AD, 8 were incorrectly clinically diagnosed with probable AD at the last clinic evaluation. The clinical diagnosis of AD at the last clinical evaluation had 97.1% sensitivity and 57.9% specificity for autopsy-verified AD. In this Latino cohort, clinicians predicted AD pathological findings with high sensitivity but moderate specificity. Tangle only dementia was the most common misdiagnosis. Conclusion: Our study suggests that current procedures and instruments to clinically determine AD in Latinos have high sensitivity compared with neuropathology, but specificity needs to be improved.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Moreover, muscle mass profiles and their relationship to dementia trajectories have not been extensively investigated. We investigated factors which affect the rate of clinical decline and the usefulness of muscle profiles for predicting the clinical outcomes of dementia patients with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Method: Sixty-nine subjects with probable AD, but without muscle weakness, were included this study. Variables including age, years of education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lacunar infarcts, baseline cognition, muscle mass, and strength were assessed during the initial visit of each subject. Over a period of three years, each subject received an annual evaluation that included a clinical interview and an assessment of their cognitive status as measured by a Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for associations between each factor and the CDR-SOB score over time. These analyses were then repeated in a multivariate linear mixed-effects model after adjusting the covariates. Result: Age, DM, and baseline severity were identified as potential covariates that influence clinical progression; however, a subject’s muscle profile was not found to predict dementia progression. Conclusion: We expect that early screening and intervention, as well as new drugs with mechanisms of action similar to those of antidiabetic medications, will help patients with dementia maintain their clinical status.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Caroline Komatsu, MS, UNIRIO - ESCOLA DE MEDICINA E CIRURGIA, RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil and Ricardo S. Komatsu, MD, MSc, PhD, FAMEMA - Marilia Medical School, Marilia, BrazilBackground: Vitamin D has been investigated in association with cognitive function in older adults. According to the systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Anweiler et al (2013), Alzhelmer’s disease (AD) cases had lower serum vitamin D concentrations than matched controls, which reinforces the conceptualization of vitamin D as a ‘neurosteroid hormone’ and as a potential biomarker of AD. The quality assessment of systematic reviews of vitamin D, cognition and dementia conducted by Aghajafari et al (2018) also corroborated the potential link between low serum vitamin D concentrations and dementia. Methods: 54 outpatients with the diagnostic of AD according to criteria proposed by NINCDS-ADRDA (2011), followed – up in a Geriatrics Clinic, had their vitamin D levels assessed and MMSE scores evaluated. Results: 39 (72,2%) patients presented vitamin D normal range (vitamin D level ≥ 30 ng/mL) and 15 (27,78%) patients presented vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D level < 30 ng/mL). From the vitamin D normal range group 8 patients (20,51%) presented moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE: 10 to 20) and 31 patients (79,49%) presented mild cognitive impairment (MMSE > 20). From the vitamin D deficiency group 1 patient (6,67%) presented severe cognitive impairment (MMSE < 10), 3 patients (20%) presented moderate cognitive impairment and 11 patients (73,33%) presented mild cognitive impairment. Both groups, vitamin D normal range and vitamin D deficiency, presented on average the same educational level: 8,12 and 8,38 years respectively. Conclusion: In this sample of patients with AD, vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower MMSE scores when compared to vitamin D normal range.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Method: A 39-year old man gradually developed a decline in cognitive functions with spastic gait and parkinsonism. The patient was initially diagnosed with a progressive variant of young-onset dementia or parkinsonism. But gait disturbances and cognitive impairment became more severe, and then the differential diagnosis was made for other causes including genetic testing. Result: Brain MRI showed fronto-temporal atrophy with hyperintense multiple small lesions in the deep cerebral white matter, and deep white matter diffusion abnormalities. The DNA analysis revealed a novel missense mutation c.2349C>A (p.Asn783Gln) of the CSF1R gene.

Lo, MD, PhD1,2, (1)Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan, (2)Tzu Chi University, Hualien, TaiwanBackground: Many neurodegenerative and non-degenerative diseases contribute to cognitive complaints seen in a memory clinic; however, little is known about their distribution and mortality risk. Method: We enrolled consecutive patients from the memory clinic in Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital during 2013/3-2016/10. Diagnoses were made on clinical grounds including interview, blood test, cognitive assessment and neuroimaging data. Our diagnostic categories included Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and various non-degenerative causes. Each patient might receive more than one diagnosis. We described the frequency of different dementia subtypes and secondary causes. All patients were censored until death or 09/30/2018. Death records were obtained from the National Death Registry of Taiwan and confirmed by medical records review. Post-diagnosis survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. We employed Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the mortality risks of clinical diagnoses after adjusting for age, gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Result: The study comprised 727 patients with a mean age at 72.6 years and female preponderance. Nearly one-third of patients (n=231, 31.8%) came to the clinic with subjective cognitive decline (n=53) or other non-degenerative causes including anxiety/depression (n=65) and traumatic brain injury (n=23). Among patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases (n=496), 69% had one subtype of dementia (case number: AD=215, VaD=58, PDD=45, FTD=14, DLB=10) and 31% had mixed dementia in which AD plus VaD was the most common combination. During a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, 150 deaths were documented and the mortality risk was 61 deaths/1000 person-years. Post-diagnosis survival was shortest among mixed dementia, followed by single-type dementia and non-degenerative causes (log-rank test: p<0.001); however, clinical diagnoses did not significantly predict mortality after taking age, gender and MMSE into account in Cox regression models. Conclusion: Clinical diagnoses for patients in a memory clinic are diverse and the majority are mixed dementia or non-degenerative conditions. Age, gender and MMSE scores at diagnosis are stronger predictors for survival than clinical diagnosis per se.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Mok, FRCP, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, NT, Hong KongBackground: Data on early-onset dementia in Chinese is limited. This study aimed to report the diagnostic profiles and characteristics of patients with suspected early-onset dementia in a university-affiliated movement and cognitive disorder clinic in Hong Kong. Method: We prospectively collected data of consecutive patients who were referred to the movement and cognitive disorder clinic at Prince of Wales Hospital between January 2012 and Dec 2018. All patients were referred for diagnostic evaluation of cognitive symptoms, with or without concomitant motor symptoms. Patients with symptom-onset at age 65 or before were recruited. We excluded patients with (1) cognitive deficits referable to an isolated event or toxin; (2) significant mood disorders; or (3) no objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Result: Of the 93 patients included, four patients had temporal lobe epilepsy mimicking dementia. Three patients had cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, one patient had Niemann-Pick disease type C and two patients had undetermined aetiology. The remaining 83 patients had primary degenerative dementia. The most frequent diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (n = 58, 70%), followed by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 18, 22%) and parkinsonian disorders (n = 7, 8%). The mean age of symptom onset was 57.8 ± 5.8. The youngest AD patient had PSEN1 mutation. Ten (17%) AD patient had non-amnestic presentations. Fifteen FTD patients consented for mutation screening in the GRN (progranulin), MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and C9orf72 genes, none were positive. Conclusion: Early-onset dementia had a broader differential diagnoses than late-onset dementia, and includes a number of rare hereditary diseases.

Rapp, PhD1, (1)Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, (2)University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA, USABackground: As people age and the incidence of dementia continues to increase, studies of cognitive function continue to be of importance. Ascertaining cognitive data through different mechanisms is necessary to address missing data concerns. Method: The Dementia Questionnaire (DQ), which utilizes proxy-based assessments, is a potential tool to determine cognitive status in participants no longer being followed per traditional study protocol. The DQ is currently being used in the Supplemental Case Ascertainment Protocol (SCAP) which is being conducted in an ongoing study of post-menopausal women as part of the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS). Result: 94% of the 1260 SCAP participants were eligible due to being deceased. Those who are SCAP eligible were older, less likely to be a minority, were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and prior history of CVD as well as being a past or current smoker. SCAP added 109 cases of probable dementia to WHIMS. Risk factor relationships were modified upon inclusion of the SCAP cases including an attenuation of a hormone therapy effect and discovery of a hypertension effect. Conclusion: Augmenting clinic-based cases with proxy-based assessments is feasible and lead to increased incident cases of dementia. When planning future clinical trials, it may be of study benefit to include a protocol of proxy-based assessments, develop strong relationships with proxies early on in the study, and attempt to maintain this relationship throughout the lifespan of the trial.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Jun Hong Lee, MD, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang-si, Korea, Republic of (South)Background: Previous studies have reported conflicting results about the prevalence of seizures in AD, and few epidemiological studies in the Asia have been found. We examine the demographic, clinical characteristics and the incidence for seizures with AD patients compared to non-AD patients in a prospective, longitudinal, community-based cohort with long follow-up. Method: The data was collected from National Health Insurance Service-National Elderly cohort(NHIS-elderly) Database to define patients with AD from 2004-2006 based on having KCD code G30, F00. We performed a 1:5 case-control matched analysis using propensity score matching, which were based on age, sex and household income. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to estimate the risk of epilepsy in AD. Result: In the cohort study, the patients with AD have higher chances for epilepsy than those without AD. The Hazard ratios for epilepsy with AD are 2.773(95% CI: 2.515-3.057). The study also shows that the gender male, comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of developing epilepsy. Patients have 1.527 (95% CI: 1.375–1.695) times higher mortality rate when epilepsy occurred in the AD group than in the control group.

The term 'anosognosia' refers to the failure to acknowledge the impairment resulting from pathological process, and adequately appreciate its severity and progression. Methods: A body of literature relating to anosognosia in AD was critically reviewed. Results: Firstly, while anosognosia is considered as a key – even not universal - feature of AD in the advanced stages, there is a lack of consensus regarding its presence in preclinical and prodromal stages. Conflicting evidence were found studying psychometrically-normal subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment, both ranging from full to deficient awareness of subtle and overt cognitive changes, respectively. This divergence is probably due to inconsistencies between diagnostic criteria or measures used. However, recent studies seem to confirm the presence of an early reduction of awareness and its potential use as marker of AD pathology (Cacciamani et al., 2017). Secondly, many studies showed correlations between unawareness and scores on tests of executive functions. Consistently, anosognosia was found to be related to a pattern of frontotemporoparietal dysfunction (see Figure), leading to a suboptimal ability to (i) compare current and past performance due to memory deficits; (ii) update knowledge about self; and (iii) judge the own performance assuming a third-person perspective (Perrotin et al., 2015; Fogarty et al., 2016). Anosognosia was also found to be associated with better perceived quality of life and less depression (Cines et al., 2015). Finally, the lack of awareness of impairment has various implications: it contributes to high levels of caregiver’s commitment and responsibility, increasing in turn his/her feelings of alienation (Conde-Sala et al., 2016); it negatively affects the ability to provide an informed consent and to make decisions about health (Karlawish et al., 2005); and intervention programs were shown to be less effective in unaware patients (Clare et al., 2004). Conclusion: Anosognosia in AD is a topic of growing interest. A more comprehensive conceptualization is needed to model the loss of awareness of cognitive functioning over the course of the disease, and to place it in the sequence of events due to the pathological process.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

We examined the relationship between insomnia and the risk of dementia including mortality and a long-term care facility admission of dementia patients, as well as the interaction between insomnia and known cardiovascular risks through subgroup analysis. Method: 2,796,871 patients diagnosed with insomnia (G47.0) by ICD-10 codes between 2007 to 2014 were enrolled. 5,593,742 controls were matched by a Greedy digit match algorithm. The propensity score matched analysis was done using variables that could affect the outcomes such as age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, congestive heart failure, and history of ischemic stroke. The follow-up diagnoses of AD (F00,G31.1) and VD (F01) were analysed by ICD-10 codes. The adjusted hazard ratio of mortality rate and admission to a long-term care facility was calculated with multivariable Cox analysis. Result: Among 2,796,871 insomnia patients, 138,270 patients were newly diagnosed with AD, and 26,706 patients with VD. Patients diagnosed with insomnia showed higher incidence rate than controls in both AD (Adjusted incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.73 [1.72-1.75, 95%CI]) and VD (IRR 2.1 [2.06-2.14, 95%CI]), respectively. The risk of both AD and VD in the insomnia group were higher in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Dementia patients both in AD and VD in the insomnia group showed a higher mortality rate than the non-insomnia group (Adjusted hazard ratio, HR 1.066 [1.038-1.095,95%CI] for AD, HR 1.077 [1.011-1.147, 95%CI]). Likewise, the proportion and duration of admission to a long-term care facility is higher in dementia in the insomnia group (Adjusted hazard ratio, HR 1.242 [1.205-1.279, 95%CI] for AD, HR 1.208 [1.126-1.295, 95%CI]). Conclusion: In this study using nationwide population data, insomnia increases the risk of AD and VD.

HDLS results from mutations in the CSF1R gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Method: We describe the clinical and neuroimaging features of two cases of HDLS evaluated at our medical center.and compare them with previously reported cases. Result: Both patients had clinical genetic testing done revealing mutations in CSF1R. Patient 1 is a 46 year old woman who initially presented with gait changes and dysarthria, with rapid progression of bulbar and cognitive symptoms over 18 months, and was found to have a mutation in exon 19, c.2519C>G (p.Ser840Cys). Patient 2 is a 56 year old man presenting with 3 years of depression and memory problems without significant motor symptoms in the context of a family history of early onset dementia syndrome in his mother and prior diagnosis of HDLS in his maternal aunt; he was also found to have a mutation in exon 19, c.2480T>A (p.Ile827Asn). Both patients demonstrated extensive white matter hyperintensities and thinning of the corpus callosum on their MRIs with Patient 1 having cavitary lesions. Both mutations are located in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein at or near the location of previously described mutations. Both mutations are predicted to be probably damaging by Polyphen with a score of 1.0. Conclusion: To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of HDLS associated with these mutations. As has been described in the literature, the female patient had a younger age of onset than the male. Clinicians should be aware of the diversity of clinical presentations of HDLS and consider genetic testing for atypical dementia syndromes associated with significant white matter changes.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

We aimed to investigate demographic and cognitive measures as predictors for decline in EOAD, in individuals attending memory clinic for under 65 years of age in an European setting. Method: Subjects were consecutive patients assessed and followed up at a specialist memory service at a university teaching hospital between 2000-2010. Dementia diagnosis was made using ICD 10 criteria. Demographical measures, clinical and cognitive assessment using MMSE and CamCog at baseline were used as potential predictors of outcome at follow-up assessment at final attendance to the clinic. Outcomes was classified as those with slower decline (SD) who continued to follow up within the outpatient service or discharged back home as stable or as rapid decliners (RD) who needed transfer to other services such as community mental health team, inpatient services, placement to institutional care or death. Result: Of the 101 people (55 women; 58.9± 4.8 years) diagnosed with EOAD during this period, 26 patients had slower decline and 75 rapid decliners (69 transferred to other services, 4 to institutional care and 2 died). People with RD had lower education (p=0.021), shorter duration of illness (p=0.039), more family history of dementia (p=0.008, X2(1) = 9.57), were on antidepressants (p<0.001, X2(1) = 36.1) and not on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (p=0.04, X2(1) = 10.07). Lower scores in orientation, attention and calculation, recent memory and abstract thinking on the CamCog test at baseline were found to predict a faster disease progression and poorer outcome.  Conclusion: Identification of predictors of faster disease progression have significant clinical benefit, allowing clinicians to estimate prognosis and plan patient care accordingly.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

It was originally designed to be evaluated by the informants who knew the patient very well. However, the number of the elderly living independently without family members and visiting memory clinic without informants has been increasing in Korea. We compared self and informant conducted KDSQ-C to validate self-evaluated KDSQ-C for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia Method: 200 normal control, 50 MCI and 170 dementia subjects over 65 years old and their informants from 11 hospitals were recruited for this study. KDSQ-C was completed separately by participants and their informants. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was conducted by participants only. The sensitivity and specificity of KDSQ-C and the MMSE for diagnosing MCI and dementia were calculated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Result: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for the KDSQ-C evaluated by participants and informant for the diagnosis of dementia were 0.75 and 0.92 separately. KDSQ-C (cut-off point 6) rated by participants had a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 77% for diagnosis of MCI and a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 77% for diagnosis of dementia. Caregiver evaluated KDSQ-C (cut-off point 6) had a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 79% for MCI and a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 79% of dementia. The AUC for MMSE was 0.95 and at a cut-off score 24/25, it showed a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 92% for the diagnosis of dementia. The AUCs for the MMSE and caregiver evaluated KDSQ-C was not different significantly (p> 0.05) to diagnose MCI or dementia. Conclusion: Informant-rated KDSQ-C had better discriminative ability than did participants-rated KDSQ-C and had similar screening power to MMSE to diagnose MCI or dementia. However, KDSQ-C can be rated by participants to screen dementia when an informant is not available.

The s head turn sign (HTS) is the movement that the patient performs before a specific question of the examiner looking for the answer in the partner. The objective of the study is to evaluate the HTS sign and its capacity for the diagnosis of dementia in a cognitive neurology consultation Method: A prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients who attended to a cognitive neurology service. The HTS was evaluated in these patients when asked about the current age. The presence of dementia was determined according to the NIA-AA clinical criteria and the probable etiologic diagnoses was classified as degenerative or non-degenerative. The Folstein minimental state (MMSE) was administered to the evaluated patients. The epi info 7.2.1 was used for the statistical analysis Result: Total 150 patients were evaluated, mean age 76 (SD 8.6). 48% had a clinical diagnosis of dementia, with degenerative disease being the cause in 66%. The HTS had a sensitivity of 41.7% and a specificity of 97% for the diagnosis of dementia, presenting a positive predictive value of 93.7% and a negative predictive value of 64.4%. Those who presented positive HTS had a higher risk of degenerative disease with OR 10.5 95% CI 1.36-81. (p = 0.003). The positive HTS was associated with a lower MMSE (Mean 19.22 DS 2.1 versus negative HTS 23.44 DS 5) (p = 0.0037) Conclusion: Consistent with some previous ones, the HTS showed to be a simple and highly specific assessment for the diagnosis of dementia, so its administration is potentially very useful to include in patients evaluation",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two most common forms of degenerative EOD. Our aim was to investigate the patterns of inheritance and gene mutation status in consecutive degenerative EOD patients. Method: Two hundred and seven consecutive patients diagnosed according to the current clinical criteria for AD and FTD spectrum were recruited from the Neurology Clinic, Clinical Centre of Serbia from 01.04.2012. until 01.04.2017. Result: One third of AD and FTD patients had familial form of dementia, while the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern existed in 4.7% and 7.7% of probands with AD and FTD, respectively. The gene mutations were identified in 7.3% familial AD (a third of AD patients with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern) and in 1.2% sporadic AD patients; 25% familial FTD patients were gene mutation carriers (half of FTD patients with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern) along with 7% of sporadic FTD patients. Only 3.1% of the total population of AD and 10.3% of FTD possessed known gene mutations. Conclusion: EOD does not appear to be a strongly inherited autosomal dominant condition. The majority of patients were sporadic. Common gene mutations do not explain the total autosomal dominant burden.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Dickson, MD and Nilufer Ertekin-Taner, MD, PhD, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USABackground: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified association of common variants at the ABCA7 locus with risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). Subsequent sequencing studies identified increased burden of ABCA7 putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants in LOAD patients compared with controls. Similar findings have been reported for Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other neurodegenerative pathologies, implicating a potential role for ABCA7 across multiple neurodegenerative conditions. Clinical features of ABCA7 pLOF mutation carriers have yet to be explored extensively. We hypothesize there may be distinguishing clinical features of ABCA7 pLOF mutation carriers, and that some of these features may be mutation specific. Method: Genotypes were performed on 3,284 participants from Mayo Clinic Florida for 6 reported ABCA7 pLOF variants (p.E709fs, p.Trp1214X, p.L1403fs, c.4416+2T>G, p.E1679X, c.5570+5G>C). A neurology resident, blinded to the pLOF variants, performed a retrospective chart review on 43 mutation-carriers with available clinical data, for demographics, clinical features and available test results. Result: Of the 6 genotyped mutations, observed counts ranged from 1 to 24 individuals. Overall, 20/43 mutation carriers were male, and 23/43 were female. Twenty had advanced dementia, 10 had mild to moderate AD, 5 had mild cognitive impairment, 3 had alternative neurodegenerative diagnoses (Lewy body, PD, corticobasal degeneration), and 6 had no cognitive deficits. The average age of symptom onset was 66.15 years, ranging from 52-75, amongst dementia patients. Individuals with the earliest age of onset had atypical features including posterior cortical atrophy, primary progressive aphasia, behavioral changes, or extrapyramidal findings. Depression was more common amongst carriers of the four least frequent mutations (8/10), when compared to the two most frequent mutations (13/33). The prevalence of additional selected clinical features will be compared between mutation carriers and the broader cohort to identify additional differentiating features. Conclusion: Studies of pLOF variants at the ABCA7 locus show increased risk for LOAD. Our in-depth clinical review of this cohort suggests that certain variants have an early onset of atypical symptoms and have other differentiating features. Identifying clinical features associated with specific genetic risk factors may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the disease and enable patient classification relevant for biomarker studies and clinical trials.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

We set out to evaluate the prevalence and natural history of seizures using a large prospective data set with standardized clinical assessment. Method: National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) data gathered at 34 centers between 2005 and 2016 were analyzed for seizure prevalence in different AD stages and for association of seizure risk with disease duration. We also studied seizure recurrence risk as well as associations between seizures and age of AD onset, and cognitive and functional capability. Fisher’s exact test, logistic regression and a generalized linear model were used. Result: Data from 20745 individuals were available. Seizure prevalence was higher in AD dementia than in normal controls (active seizures: 1.51% vs. 0.35%, p<0.0001, OR=4.34, 95% CI=3.01-6.27; seizure history: 3.14% vs. 1.57%; p<0.0001; OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.67-2.46), but was not increased in pre-dementia stages (Figure 1). Prevalence of active seizures rose with duration of AD dementia (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.39-1.73, p<0.0001), from 1.51% at 4.8 years of disease duration to 5.43% at 11 years (Figure 2). Seizure recurrence risk in AD dementia was 70.4% within 7.5 months. A seizure history was associated with both a younger age of onset of cognitive symptoms (seizures vs. no seizures: 64.7 vs. 70.4 years; p<0.0001) and worse cognitive and functional performance (mean MMSE score: 16.6 vs. 19.6; mean CDR-SB score: 9.3 vs. 6.8; p<0.0001; adjusted for age and disease duration). Conclusion: Patients with AD are at an increased risk for seizures, in particular in more advanced disease stages. In AD dementia, seizures have an exceptional high recurrence risk. Based on this finding, one seizure in AD patients could lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy according to the current guidelines of the International League Against Epilepsy and may implicate an antiepileptic treatment. Seizures in AD are associated with poor cognitive course and reduced functional performance. Our findings emphasize a need for seizure history assessment in AD to inform individual therapeutic decisions and the necessity of systematic treatment studies of AD-associated epilepsy.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Moreover, muscle mass profiles and their relationship to dementia trajectories have not been extensively investigated. We investigated factors which affect the rate of clinical decline and the usefulness of muscle profiles for predicting the clinical outcomes of dementia patients with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Method: Sixty-nine subjects with probable AD, but without muscle weakness, were included this study. Variables including age, years of education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lacunar infarcts, baseline cognition, muscle mass, and strength were assessed during the initial visit of each subject. Over a period of three years, each subject received an annual evaluation that included a clinical interview and an assessment of their cognitive status as measured by a Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for associations between each factor and the CDR-SOB score over time. These analyses were then repeated in a multivariate linear mixed-effects model after adjusting the covariates. Result: Age, DM, and baseline severity were identified as potential covariates that influence clinical progression; however, a subject’s muscle profile was not found to predict dementia progression. Conclusion: We expect that early screening and intervention, as well as new drugs with mechanisms of action similar to those of antidiabetic medications, will help patients with dementia maintain their clinical status.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

It has been shown that the ε4 allele accelerates the amyloid accumulation in the elderly population, it is unknown whether it affects the speed of disease progression after onset. We examined the effects of the ε4 allele on the presence of amyloid as well as the progression rate of cognitive decline in the MCI and mild AD population in the Japanese (J-) ADNI cohort and compared with those of North American (NA) ADNI. Method: 233 late MCI, 149 mild AD and 151 cognitive normal (CN) subjects from J-ADNI, whose APOE genotypes were available, were analyzed and compared with 562 late MCI, 342 mild AD and 417 CN from NA-ADNI. Amyloid positivity was defined as the positivity of amyloid PET or low concentration of Aβ(1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid under the cutoff levels (333 pg/ml in J-ADNI and 192 pg/ml in NA-ADNI). Progression rates of cognitive decline were evaluated by changes of the total score of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square analysis for categorical data and ANOVA for numerical data. Result: Amyloid positivity rates were significantly higher in the APOE ε4 positive group (CN: 47.2%, MCI: 88.9%, AD: 93.9%) compared with the APOE ε4 negative group (NC: 7.1%, MCI: 45.6%, AD: 75%) in all three clinical groups of J-ADNI, which was recapitulated in the NA-ADNI. The progression rates of cognitive decline in the APOE ε4 positive late MCI was higher than those in the APOE ε4 negative late MCI both in J- and NA-ADNI. However, the progression rates of cognitive decline were at similar levels in the amyloid-positive late MCI (= prodromal AD) and mild AD both in J- and NA-ADNI.

Abstract:Qiumin Qu, PhD, MD and Meilin She, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, ChinaBackground: A growing body of evidence indicates that hypertension may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease(AD). Considering the close relationship between peripheral amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance and brain Aβ deposition, we investigated the potential association between blood pressure (BP) level and plasma Aβ concentrations. Method: A total of 1069 participants (age above 45) from a village in the suburbs of Xi'an, China were enrolled finally. A questionnaire was used to collect vascular risk factors and a validated Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess cognition. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Plasma Aβ levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The associations between BP and plasma Aβ levels were determined by multiple linear regressions. Result: Plasma Aβ1-40 level was higher in hypertension group than that in non- hypertension group (53.41±8.57 pg/ml vs. 51.87±8.92 pg/ml, P=0.002), in elevated SBP group than that in normal SBP group (53.68±8.69 pg/ml vs. 51.88±8.80 pg/ml, P=0.001), in elevated MAP group than that in normal MAP group (54.05±8.79 pg/ml vs. 52.04±8.75 pg/ml, P=0.001 ). After controlling the confounding factors, SBP (b=0.068, P<0.001), DBP (b=0.071, P=0.019) and MAP (b=0.087, P=0.001) were associated with plasma Aβ1-40 level positively, while SBP (b=-0.001, P=0.027), DBP (b=-0.001, P=0.040), and MAP (b=-0.001, P=0.022) were associated with plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratios negatively, but Aβ1-42 did not. The relationships between BP and plasma Aβ levels did not change after stratification by APOE ε4 status. Conclusion: Elevated BP levels were associated with increased plasma Aβ1-40 level and decreased Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio in middle-aged and old villagers.

Abstract:Chen Ling Koh, Undergraduate BSocSci (Hons), National Neuroscience Institute/ SingHealth, Singapore, SingaporeBackground: Although the differences in the cognitive profile between AD and Vascular Dementia (VaD) have been extensively studied, there is likely to have been overlap between the 2 groups as AD and VaD were defined using only clinical criteria. Comparison of the cognitive profile of AD and VaD using biomarker supported diagnosis is needed. Method: 68 participants (Mage=58.1, Meducation= 11.7 years, 32 males) were recruited from a tertiary dementia centre. Participants underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for AD biomarkers. Participants with established AD range β-amyloid were classified as Pure AD group while patients with Staal’s Cerebrovascular Disease score of at least 1 and β-amyloid not in the AD range were classified as Pure VaD. Healthy Controls did not have AD range β-amyloid and had a zero Staals score. All participants underwent evaluation for global cognition, executive function, attention/working memory, language, episodic memory and visuospatial domains. Regression analysis was used to test the associations between cognitive domains and diagnostic groups. Results: Participants with AD and VaD were comparable on demographic and vascular risk factors. Global cognition (MMSE) was not significantly different between AD and VaD. Episodic Memory and Attention/Working memory was significantly worse in Pure AD. Executive function was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Using biomarker confirmed diagnosis for AD and VaD, the clinical believe that patients with VaD have worse executive function and attention span compared to AD was not demonstrated.

Abstract:Cheng-Yu Wei, MD, MS, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan and Pai-Yi Chiu, MD, PhD, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, TaiwanBackground: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is highly associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, seldom studies investigated the prevalence or association factors of RBD in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Method: Prevalence of RBD was determined according to either the ICSD minimal criteria for clinical diagnosis of RBD. Prevalence of RBD in different stages of AD were summarized. The association factor for RBD were analyzed using multivariable risk estimates (Odd ratios, ORs) for patients with RBD (RBD +) compared to those without RBD (RBD–). Result: This is a retrospective analysis of data from the Dementia and Movement disorders Center in Show Chwan Memorial Hospital. A total of 2085 patients were studied. Among them, 110 patients had RBD (5.3%). The RBD+ group had higher disease severity according to CDR. After adjusting for disease severity, DLB features including fluctuations in cognition (p=0.018), visual hallucinations (p<0.001), and parkinsonism (p<0.001) were more frequent in the RBD+ group. Furthermore, total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score (p=0.004) was higher in the RBD+ group. Lower scores in the domains of attention (p=0.010) and language (p=0.020) of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was associated with RBD in AD. Conversely, none of the vascular risk factors (VRFs) was associated with RBD in AD. Conclusion: RBD, albeit occurring at a low rate, had a high impact on AD.

Abstract:Murat Gultekin, MD, Erciyes University School Of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Kayseri, TurkeyBackground: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorders associated with degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. The patients may present with a wide range of symptoms, including prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms that often mimic other psychiatric disorders. Initial psychiatric diagnoses, such as psychosis or depression, are common. Early diagnosis of FTD may challenge due to behavioral and psychotic symptoms. Method: A patient with FTD misdiagnosed as psychosis was presented as case report in this paper. Result: A female patient, 57 years, female, had depressive symptoms, include personality and behavioral changes for 3 years. She was admitted to a psychiatry clinic with newly developed psychotic symptoms, consisting of both delusions and auditory hallucinations. Thus, she was diagnosed as psychosis and treated antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride and quetiapin). However, the patient's complains was progressed in time and there was no reponse to treatment. Then she developed progressive apathy, compulsiveness, and executive dysfunction. The patient history include that the patient's mother and two aunts had similar symptoms at similar ages but they were not diagnosed. After last visit of psychiatry clinic the patient was referred to neurology dementia clinic. The patient's MMSE score was 21/30. Also, she had high depression score. Scores of frontal lobe battery test was impaired and it was found associated with FTD. There was seen markedly frontal and parietal atrophy on cranial MRI scan. Conclusion: Currently, psychotic symptoms are not included in current diagnostic criteria for FTD, but need to be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with FTD. Also, the risk of misdiagnosis is particularly high in these individuals being diagnosed with psychiatric rather than neurodegenerative disease.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:John E. Schneider, PhD and Jacie Cooper, Avalon Health Economics, Morristown, NJ, USABackground: The global burden of dementia is about $1 trillion, annually, and one of the most challenging aspects of dementia is accurate and timely diagnosis and monitoring. In this paper, we develop a conceptual model to identify the economic aspects of a novel dementia diagnostic (referred to as “DDx”). We describe the logic and evidence surrounding the “cost offset” aspects associated with the use of DDx due, in part, to its increased speed and accuracy of diagnosis which ultimately leads to earlier disease-modifying treatments. Method: The conceptual model focuses on four potential cost-driver domains: (1) diagnosis, (2) treatment, (3) outcomes, and (4) institutional care. We adopt a U.S. payer perspective and depict a hypothetical medical decision whereby patients from the base cohort can be “primarily diagnosed” via either the standard of care arm or the DDx arm. The main hypotheses are that the two arms may not be mutually exclusive in terms of testing, yet DDx is reflective of a more accurate and efficient approach. We then develop a cost analysis based on the main cost drivers and the flow of our model, alongside our own reasonable assumptions and cost evidence found in the literature. Result: Faster time-to-treatment results in three desirable outcomes: (1) creating more opportunity to deliver optimal treatment, including the optimal mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments; (2) a delay in institutional care facility (ICF) admission; and (3) faster time-to-treatment has also been shown to reduce avoidable hospitalizations, which is also an important component of the overall costs of dementia. Summing these effects, the net potential savings attributable to DDx is $11,156, which represents a 13.8% savings per episode of dementia, compared to the standard of care. Savings are driven by reduction in diagnostic costs, hospitalization costs, and ICF costs. Conclusion: The savings attributable to DDx will accrue to different stakeholders in the U.S. in different ways. Fully-integrated health systems would accrue savings directly to the payers, while commercial insurance markets would experience shared savings between commercial health insurers and long-term care.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

GDR and MMSE were used for assessing the severity of cognitive impairment. Result: Neuropsychological studies showed the results of cognitive functions: in group I - GDR 5,0 ± 0,5 scores, MMSE 21,8 ± 4,05 scores. In group II - GDR 2,0 ± 0,5 scores, MMSE 27,0 ± 0,5 scores. Senile dementia develops in commonly characterized by a relatively sparse confabulation products. Confabulation shifted to a more or less distant past ideas about the environmental situation and the self (amnestic confabulation). At the stage of mild dementia clearly identified the most features of amnestic aphasia, amnestic disorder component of praxis, and in some cases, signs of constructive dyspraxia. There is a long preservation of motor component of praxis. Conclusion: The total scores on the MMSE and the GDR is a sensitive indicator of cognitive deficits and higher cortical functions of mild to moderate AD before, is effective in determining therapeutic approaches and tactics of early prevention in patients with AD.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Raul Alejandro Basante Avendaño Sr., MD, Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía, Mexico, MexicoBackground: Social cognition is the cognitive domain responsible for achieving adequate adaptation and social regulation; It has four components: 1: Theory of the mind (ToM); 2: Social perception; 3: Individual alertness, and 4: Executive functions (EF). The practical judgment (JP) is a high level cognitive function that in its process has to: evaluate situations, draw conclusions (after evaluating the context), consider possible consequences and on base of all these components, to take decisions. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an entity between normal aging and dementia characterized by a deterioration in previous cognitive functioning without causing loss of functionality. Dementia is characterized by a progressive cognitive deterioration with impact on functionality that causes disability and dependence. Method: Four groups were included: 10 AMCS, 10 DCL, 15 for the groups of AD and FTD-bv. Al o them were evaluated with the following battery for EF: Stroop test (ST), trail making test b (TMT-b), verbal semantic fluency (VSf) and phonetics (VFf) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; Two tests for ToM: reading the mind through the gaze (RME) and images of the facial affection (POFA) and for the practical judgment test (ToPJ).Result: The analyses of the associations between the performance of the ToPJ with the EF and ToM tests in the cognitive a continuum (all the groups n=50), we found significant correlations with FvS, TMT-b, the cate. Conclusion: Performance in ToM tests and 3/5 EF tests showed relation with the performance in ToPJ. It is recommended to evaluate a bigger number of participants in order to analyze the association with each diagnoses group and also with the brain regions typically affected in these different conditions.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Abstract:Adeline Rollin, MD, CHU Lille, Lille, FranceBackground: Early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) defined by a disease before the age of 65 is the most frequent dementia in young people and is characterized by a number of clinical specificities compared to patients with late onset AD (LOAD). The objective of this study was to describe clinical presentation of patients with EOAD at inclusion in the COMAJ cohort (COhorte de Malades Alzheimer Jeunes). Method: All patients included in the COMAJ cohort (EOAD cohort with disease onset before 60) at Lille the memory clinic (North of France) between June 2009 and December 2017 with possible to certain AD criteria based on the NIA and the IWG were selected. Clinical (medical and family history, clinical examination, age at first symptoms…), neuropsychological, social, biological (CSF biomarkers of AD), genetics, imaging (MRI and FDG-PET scan) and neuropathological data were collected using a standardized medical work-up until death or withdrawal. Result: We included 205 patients (female: 61.5%) with a mean age of 58 years at inclusion; 167 had a probable AD, 20 a possible AD and 18 a certain AD. Time interval between first symptoms and inclusion in the cohort was 4.9 ±8.9 years (mean MMSE score: 14.5±7.1); 61% of patients had a typical clinical presentation (amnestic presentation); 7.6% had a pathogenic genetic mutation (PS1, APP mutations and APP duplications); so far 55 patients are deceased (post mortem brain donation was obtained in 35.5% of them). Time between first symptoms and death was 11.1 years ± 4.1 (range 2-19.1).

Abstract:Ruby Castilla-Puentes, MD, DrPH, MBA, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH, USABackground: There is abundant information about seizures as part of the spectrum of findings presented by patients with Alzheimer’s disease. However, the information about New Onset Seizures and seizure types is very scarce. . Method: The risk of new onset seizures and the types of convulsions associated to a dementia diagnosis are estimated. A cohort of 2’885,336 patients with/without dementia and 60 years of age or more from the Optum Insight Clinformatics-data Mart database was followed from 2005 to 2014. Group differences were analyzed using continuity-adjusted chi-square and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals calculated after a logistic regression analysis. Result: A total of N=79,561 patients (2.8%) from the cohort had a dementia diagnosis, with 56% of them been women. Dementia patients were found to have 6.5 times increased risk for undifferentiated seizures, a 6 fold elevated risk for partial seizures, and 5.2 times higher risk for generalized and undifferentiated epilepsy. Also, patients with a dementia diagnosis had 4.75 increased risk for generalized seizures, and partial epilepsy. Conclusion: In conclusion, based on U.S. national managed care database, patients of 60 years of age or older have higher risks of new onset seizures associated with a dementia diagnosis. The risk of new onset seizures associated with a diagnosis of dementia suggests the need for clinicians to monitor for seizures to ensure that patients with dementia receive an appropriate treatment",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Anosognosia Questionnaire for dementia (AQ-D) is a well-known scale for evaluating anosognosia, which was developed in English and then translated into Japanese, Italian version. This study aimed to translate AQ-D into a Korean version (AQ-D-K) and to evaluate the reliability and validity of the AQ-D-K in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. Method: We translated the original English version of AQ-D into Korean one. Eighty-four subjects with very mild or mild AD dementia (CDR 0.5~1) and their caregivers were included and responded to the questionnaire. Reliability of AQ-D-K was assessed by internal consistency and 1 month test-retest reliability. Construct validity and concurrent validity were also evaluated. Results: Internal consistency of AQ-D-K patient form (Cronbach α=0.95) and caregiver form (Cronbach α=0.93) was high. In regard of test-retest reliability, Intra-class correlation coefficient of anosognosia score (discrepancy of caregiver’s rating score and patient’s rating score) was 0.842(p<0.01). Four factors were identified in factor analysis. First, anosognosia of episodic memory. Second, anosognosia of activity of daily living and orientation. Third, anosognosia of emotional and apathetic problem. And fourth, anosognosia of disinhibition. AQ-D-K total scores were significantly correlated with clinician-rated anosognosia rating scale (ARS) scores(r=.301, p=0.005), total scores of state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI)(r=-.262, p=0.016), and center for epidemiological studies-depression (CES-D) scores(r=-.312, p=0.004), but not with any neuropsychological test scores.

Method: 60 patients were studied, 28 were randomised as MID and 32 in SIVD, according to NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherché et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences) neuroradiological criteria. Groups were matched by sex, age, education, and dementia severity. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was performed to evaluate executive functions. Result: discriminative analysis revealed differences between groups (p=0.059) and according to the discrimination coefficient (dc) the most discrminative between groups was Perseverative Responses raw score (PR) (dc=0,121), with the highest number of PR in SIVD (58 – 80) than MID (≤ 57), following by the Total Number Correct (dc=0.063) which was lower in MID (≤ 46) than SIVD ( > 55), Percent Conceptual Level Responses (dc =0.034) was lower in MID (≤ 17) than SIVD (> 26), and Total Number of Errors (dc=0.032) which was higher in MID (73-82) than in SIVD (≤ 72), Trials to Complete First Category (dc=0,014)was higher in SIVD (35-106) than MID (≤ 35), Number of Categories Completed (dc=0.013) was lower in MID (0) than SIVD (>1).

Previous instruments developed to capture the key clinical and salient aspects of patients with dementia (standard CDR and FTLD-CDR) did not include these relevant motor features. Additionally these instruments fail to capture sensitive information from a variety of sources like the individual him/herself, the informant and data from neuropsychological testing. Method: The 12-item Multidomain Impairment Rating (MIR) scale was developed to encompass all key manifestations of the FTLD spectrum disorders for use in natural history studies and clinical trials. The MIR encompasses elements of the FTLD-CDR plus a visuospatial domain as well as domains for parkinsonism, MND and other non-cognitive/non-behavioral aspects of FTLD. The ratings of 0, 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 for each domain are based on three data sources – the subject, informant, and neuropsychological testing. Consensus summary ratings include the MIR Neuropsychology score, the global (MIR), and summed score (MIR SS). Result: A reliability exercise was completed using baseline clinical and neuropsychological data in subjects participating in the ARTFL/LEFFTDS Consortium. Twenty subjects each from 2 sites were rated (blinded to the other site’s ratings), and the data of the 40 subjects were analyzed. The cases were selected a priori to represent clinically normal (CN), MCI, and more severe degrees of cognitive, behavioral and motor impairment (e.g., bvFTD, PPA, FTD with parkinsonism, and FTD with MND). Weighted kappa statistic measured agreement. The analyses showed very good agreement for the global MIR ratings [κ=0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.97)], the MIR SS ratings [κ=0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.92)], and complete concordance on the MIR Neuropsychology ratings [κ=1.0]. Conclusion: These findings suggest good reliability for the global MIR, MIR SS and MIR Neuropsychology ratings. The MIR may provide added utility to the FTLD-CDR, and could be used in natural history studies and clinical trials to more optimally capture the spectrum of features in FTLD.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Reg. (Ont.), Rehabilitation Sciences Institute University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CanadaBackground: This study examined the relationship between diagnosed sleep disorder and incident dementia in a large cohort of adult men and women with central nervous system (CNS) trauma. Method: We performed a retrospective cohort study using population based provincial health administrative data. All adults without previous dementia diagnoses entering the emergency or acute care department with diagnoses of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without spinal cord injury (SCI) between 2003 and 2013 were followed through until May 2016 to examine the occurrence of dementia. Sex-stratified cox regression models were used to investigate the relationship between presence of a diagnosed sleep disorder and incident hospitalized dementia. Result: In total, 712,708 persons with CNS trauma of all severities were included in this study. Their median age was 44 years, 59% were men. Over a median follow-up of 52 months (interquartile range, 19-86 months), 32,834 (4.6%) of the cohort developed dementia diagnoses, of which 5,083 (18%) developed Alzheimer’s disease. Controlling for age, sex, income level, injury severity and extend (TBI alone or in combination with SCI), disorders of circulatory and vascular systems, tobacco smoking, depression, and sensory impairments, diagnosed sleep disorder was a significant predictor of incident dementia: hazard ratio (HR), 1.250 [95% CI, 1.146-1.363] and Alzheimer’s disease: HR 1.328 [95% CI, 1.072-1.645]. When results were stratified by sex, the sleep disorder association with dementia remained significant in men: HR 1.255 [95% CI, 1.112-1.415] and in women: HR 1.234 [95% CI, 1.088-1.400]; but the sleep disorder association with Alzheimer’s disease remained significant in women only: HR 1.332 [95% CI, 1.072-1.645]; in men: HR 1.161 [95% CI, 0.840-1.606]. Conclusion: In a large dementia-free cohort of people with CNS trauma after controlling for multiple confounders, diagnosed sleep disorder was independently associated with a 26% and a 23% increased hazard of incident dementia in men and women, respectively. Diagnosed sleep disorder was independently associated with a 33% increased hazard of incident Alzheimer’s disease in women only. These findings support novel relationship between diagnosed sleep disorder and neurodegenerative disorders, and they may be used to enhance sex-specific preventive or therapeutic strategies for patients with CNS trauma.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

The implications of this are considerable. More sensitive outcome measures can lead to digital tools for early diagnosis or can help to power clinical trials with fewer samples. Speech is an important modality in this context because it is easy to collect and taxes both the cognitive and motor systems. Aural Analytics (A2) has a platform for monitoring motor and cognitive-linguistic outcomes both at-home and in-clinic using automated speech analytics. In this work we describe the important role that speech analysis plays as a part of a more complete brain monitoring platform and highlight a use-case from large-scale home-monitoring studies. Method: Participants download the application on their Android or iOS devices and are guided through a set of speech-elicitation tasks. A suite of back-end algorithms extracts outcome measures from the collected speech samples to generate a battery of clinically-interpretable outcome measures related to motor control, cognition, and mood/affect. Constellations of these features are relevant as outcome measures for different neurological diseases. The technology has been validated in different contexts in collaboration with clinical and academic partners. This work focuses on ongoing studies in collaboration with Barrow Neurological Institute. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with and without fronto-temporal dementia download the application on their personal device and provide periodic speech samples. In addition, they are also evaluated using clinically-standard motor and cognition rating scales. We use generalized linear models (GLMs) to evaluate the relationship between the digital battery and the clinically-standard outcome measures. Result: Preliminary analysis using a GLM reveals that the digital battery outcomes are strongly predictive of the ALS-functional rating scale. In addition, post-hoc analysis reveals that changes in the digital battery precede clinically-detectable changes.

P2-318,The Role of Sex in Motor and Cognitive Trajectories before Dementia,"Mon, Jul 15  (Pacific)",9:30am - 4:15pm,South Hall GH - Los Angeles Convention Center,https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=Session&project=AAIC19&id=34228,"Manuel Montero-Odasso, MD, PhD",Schulich School of Medicine& Dentistry,"
Abstract:Manuel Montero-Odasso, MD, PhD, Schulich School of Medicine& Dentistry, Division of Geriatric Medicine ,Western University., London, ON, Canada; Luxey Sirisegaram, MD, Gait and Brain Lab, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada and Yanina Sarquis-Adamson, PhD, Gait and Brain Lab, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, CanadaBackground: Motor (slowing of gait) and cognitive declines are common in older adults; however, the trajectories of these declines before dementia progression are only beginning to be explored. We recently reported that older adults with both motor and cognitive decline (dual-decliners) had a higher risk of progressing to dementia than individuals with either decline alone. Our aim in this study is to examine the role of sex in these cognitive and motor trajectories before dementia. Method: Data was used from the Gait and Brain Study, a prospective cohort study in community-dwelling older adults free of dementia at baseline, based at a university hospital in London, ON, Canada. Participant’s motor and cognitive trajectories were assessed twice a year for 5 years, using gait velocity and the MoCA test, respectively. We ascertained incident dementia using DSM-IV criteria and we determined the risk of progression to dementia using Cox regression models, stratifying by sex and adjusting by age and comorbidities. Result: From 207 older adults, 37 individuals (18%) progressed to dementia, from which 43% were males and 57% were females. Among dual-decliners, males had a higher risk for progressing to dementia when compared with females (Males HR: 3.90, 95%CI: 1.02-14.87, p= 0.046; Females: HR: 2.41, 95%CI: 0.72- 8.12, p= 0.155). Additionally, in males, the association becomes stronger after adjusting for comorbidities (HR: 4.36, 95%CI: 1.08-17.66, p= 0.039), whereas in females, the risk for progressing to dementia lowers when adjusting for comorbidities (HR: 1.44, 95%CI: 0.38- 5.41, p= 0.590), suggesting that number of comorbidities might be driving the association with dementia in females. Male dual-decliners showed a stronger and statistically significant association with progression to dementia when compared with females in both adjusted (Males HR: 4.4, p=0.039; Females HR: 1.4, p=0.590) and unadjusted models (Males HR: 3.9, p=0.046; Females HR: 2.4, p=0.155). Conclusion: Older adults that present both motor and cognitive decline (dual-decliners) have the highest risk to progress to dementia, particularly if they are male. Sex differences in motor and cognitive trajectories before dementia may increase accuracy of dementia risk prediction. Future studies are needed to understand mechanisms underlying our findings.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Most cases are secondary to cerebrovascular disease, other structural brain lesions, previous head trauma, neurodegenerative disease or other identifiable causes. About one third of cases are idiopathic (new idiopathic unprovoked seizures, NIS). NIS have been shown to increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease and early mortality. The correlation NIS with later development of dementia has not been studied much. We describe the development of dementia in a case series (n=74) of patients with NIS after a delay period (up to 18 years).

Method: A retrospective study was conducted in 312 patients with naMCI from May 2011 to July 2018. All patients were performed brain MRI and detailed neuropsychological tests. Based on the proposed criteria of naMCI, we classified into the single- and multiple-domain naMCI groups. We compared baseline clinical characteristics and progression to dementia between the two groups. Result: Of all patients with mild cognitive impairment, 21.9% were patients with naMCI. A total of 210 (67.3%) were classified into the single-domain group, while 102 (32.7%) were classified into multiple-domain group. The mean age was significantly higher in the multiple-domain group than in the single-domain group. The education years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination score, and mean Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score were significantly lower in the multiple-domain group than in the single-domain group. The Z-scores of neuropsychological tests in most of cognitive domains were significantly lower in the multiple-domain group than in the single-domain group. A total of 13 (4.2%) patients with naMCI progressed to mostly Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Conclusion: We present a single-center experience of clinical characteristics in patients with naMCI. Close observation of clinical profile in patients with naMCI may help identify individuals at greatest risk for dementia.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Method: 89 AD patients were included. The Pittsburgh sleep index scale (PSQI) was used to evaluate the overall sleep status. PSQI > 7 was AD with SD (AD-SD) group, PSQI < 7 was AD without SD (AD-NSD) group. Demographic data were collected. 4. The cognitive function of AD patients was evaluated by the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scale, The overall cognitive function and cognitive domains of group AD-SD and group AD-NSD were compared. To analyze the correlation between the scores of MoCA and PSQI scores in AD-SD group . Result: 1. Of the 89 patients with AD, 71 cases (79.78%) had SD. 2. There was no significant difference in gender, age, onset age, education level and course of disease between group AD-SD and group AD-NSD (P>0.05). 3. The factors of significant difference in the PSQI scale of group AD-SD and group AD-NSD included sleep quality (P < 0.01), sleep latency (P < 0.01), sleep duration (P < 0.01), sleep efficiency (P < 0.05), sleep disturban (P < 0.01), use of sleeping medicatio (P < 0.01) and daytime dysfunctio (P < 0.01). 4. Compared with group AD-NSD, the total score of MoCA scale in group AD-SD was significantly lower (P < 0.05), and delayed recall and language score were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). 5. There was a significant negative correlation between the sleep time of group AD-SD and the total score of MoCA scale and delayed recall score, there was a significant negative correlation between night SD and MoCA scores and delayed recall scores. Conclusion: The incidence of AD-SD is up to 79.78%; AD-SD patients have worse subjective sleep quality, longer sleep time, shorter sleep time, lower sleep efficiency, higher night SD, more sleep drugs, and more daytime dysfunction; General cognitive function, delayed recall and language impairment were more obvious in AD-SD patients; Sleep time and night SD in group AD-SD were related to general cognitive function and delayed recall.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)

Here we assessed the relationship between personality traits at baseline and memory at >1year in cognitively-normal older adults who were free of lifetime history of psychiatric conditions. Method: Participants were 20 older adults [5M, mean age=72.8(SD6.9), mean years of education=16.6(SD2.6), mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)=26.7(SD1.9)] with normal cognition based on neuropsychological assessment, who were free of current or past history of psychiatric illness and independent in functional abilities. At baseline and >1-year follow-up, participants completed a neuropsychological battery, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) which assesses levels of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Pearson’s r was used to examine associations between mood/personality measures at baseline and immediate recall (IR), short delayed recall (SDR) and long delayed recall (LDR) scores on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) at follow-up. A Bonferroni adjustment was used to correct for multiple comparisons (adjusted p=.002). Result: Mean interval between baseline and follow-up was 21 (SD5.1) months. Moderate correlations were found between baseline NEO-FFI openness scores and CVLT-II performance at follow-up (IR: r=.63, p=.003, SDR: r=.52, p=.02, LDR: r=.68, p=.001), with only the association between baseline NEO-FFI openness and LDR remaining significant at the adjusted p-threshold. No correlations were found between other baseline mood or personality measures and CVLT-II performance at follow-up. This pattern of results remained unchanged after controlling for follow-up interval, age, and MoCA. A linear regression model with age and NEO-FFI openness as explanatory variables accounted for 48% of the variance in LDR, with NEO-FFI emerging as a significant predictor (F (2,19)= 9.77, p=.001; NEO-FFI openness: standardized beta = .63, t=3.72, p=.002). Conclusion: Openness personality trait, but not neuroticism, depression, or anxiety, predicted delayed verbal recall at > 1 year follow-up in cognitively-normal older adults without current or lifetime history of psychiatric illness. These preliminary findings suggest that positive personality traits such as openness may serve as protective factors against cognitive decline.",Diagnosis and Prognosis,Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology),[Posters Mon] Diagnosis and Prognosis： Clinical (neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology)
